# Tree-based-Algorithms-and-Time-Series

- The goal of this project was to apply tree-based algorithms such as decision trees & random forests, and time series algorithms to solve data science problems.
- This project comprises of two parts, first on Classification and second on Time Series
- Two notebooks are shared
- The focus of most of the questions in the notebooks is to apply algorithms, write observations, and extract insights.
